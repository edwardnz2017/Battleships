# Battleships
The classic game Battleships

This is a game where you set your 5 ships on your side of the board. The computer will also automatically set theirs.

To attack, simply click on any white square of the computer's grid. Green signifies that you have attacked but missed the ships, or red which means you have hit a ship. Again, the computer will automatically do the same after you have done the action.

The game will be over when either you or the computer's five ships has been hit and sunk.

So far, this has been the most complex project I've worked on, the UI is quite simple, however the mechanics are quite complicated (for someone of my caliber). 

It was created using vanilla javascript and webpack.
